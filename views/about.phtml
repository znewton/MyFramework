<h3>About this Site</h3>
This is a framework I made for funsies from scratch.
<br><br>
When making design decisions, <a href="http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?933">mobile first</a> was always in mind. For the first development cycle of making everything work,
the page was only viewed in either a small window or the mobile inspection mode on Google Chrome. It was only after
all of the components worked on that smallest screen size that breakpoints were added: first for tablet at 628px, then
for desktop at 992px.
<br><br>
Another large design point when developing this site was an incorporation of some <a href="https://material.google.com/">material design guidelines</a>. An example
of this is the form components, where the label (placeholder) never goes away so that the user does not have to struggle
to remember what a field was for. A second example of this is the clickable elements such as buttons that have a slight
drop shadow that increases on hover to indicate action.
